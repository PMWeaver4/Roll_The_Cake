# Roll_The_Cake

A game where players go around a board with the goal of landing back on their own spot (entry location.)
The players are cakes.
The players have to roll a "1" to get onto the board. Upon rolling a "1" and getting onto the board, the player gets one more roll before it's the next player's turn.
When one player (A) lands on another player's (B) entry location, it will make it so that player B joins the board if they are not on it (summon), or leave the board if they are (expel) - in which case they will have to roll a "1" again to get back on when it is their turn, or hope another player lands on their entry location.
Boing! If one player lands on another player, it pushes the player who was landed on forward one spot. (Unless it is an "inactive player", more on that later)
The game can have up to five active players. Any less than five, the remainder of players are "inactive."
Inactive players only have one move - they can be summoned onto the board if an active player lands on their entry location.
Bounce! If an active player lands on an inactive player, the active player "bounces" one position forward.
Once an active player lands on their own entry location, the game is over.
